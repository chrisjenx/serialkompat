# Configuration

The full `serialkompat { }` extension reference: every property, its default, and
what it controls. See [Quick start](quickstart.md) for the minimal version and
[Setup](setup.md) for the CLI/Action equivalents.

## `serialkompat { }` reference

| Property | Type | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| `types` | `ListProperty<String>` | — (required) | FQNs of `@Serializable` root types to check |
| `jsonInstance` | `Property<String>` | empty | FQN of a `Json` instance describing the wire (e.g. `com.example.WireJson.instance`); empty = default `Json{}` |
| `baselineRef` | `Property<String>` | auto-detected | Git ref the current schema is checked against. Unset ⇒ auto-detect the default branch (`origin/HEAD` → `origin/main` → `origin/master` → local `main`/`master`) |
| `direction` | `Property<CompatibilityDirection>` | `FULL` | `BACKWARD`, `FORWARD`, or `FULL` |
| `failOnBreaking` | `Property<Boolean>` | `true` | A `BREAK` finding fails the build |
| `failOnEmptyBaseline` | `Property<Boolean>` | `true` | Empty baseline fails the build (prevents silently masking removed types); set `false` for first adoption |
| `include` | `ListProperty<String>` | `[""]` | Serial-name prefixes in scope (`""` = all) |
| `exclude` | `ListProperty<String>` | `[]` | Serial-name prefixes excluded |
| `acceptedBreaks` | `ListProperty<String>` | `[]` | Sanctioned breaks, format `"<serialName> <RULE> [DIRECTION]"` |
| `renames` | `MapProperty<String,String>` | `{}` | Declared serial-name moves old→new (avoids a remove+add pair reading as a break) |

The extension is config-cache safe — everything above is captured at configuration
time. `baselineRef` isn't a file on disk: the baseline schema is recomputed live
from that ref via a temporary git worktree on every run, so there's nothing to
regenerate or go stale.

## Annotated example

!!! note
    serialkompat isn't on the Gradle Plugin Portal yet, so `plugins { id(…) }` won't
    resolve on its own — see [Setup](setup.md#gradle-plugin) for the `pluginManagement`
    block that points Gradle at Maven Central.

```kotlin title="build.gradle.kts"
plugins {
    kotlin("jvm")
    kotlin("plugin.serialization")
    id("com.chrisjenx.serialkompat") version "{{ skversion }}"
}

serialkompat {
    types.set(listOf( // (1)!
        "com.example.wire.OrderEvent",
        "com.example.wire.Payment",
    ))
    jsonInstance.set("com.example.wire.WireJson.instance") // (2)!
    baselineRef.set("origin/main") // (3)!
    direction.set(CompatibilityDirection.FULL) // (4)!
    failOnBreaking.set(true) // (5)!
    failOnEmptyBaseline.set(true) // (6)!
    include.set(listOf("com.example.wire")) // (7)!
    exclude.set(listOf("com.example.wire.internal")) // (8)!
    renames.put("com.example.wire.LegacyOrder", "com.example.wire.OrderEvent") // (9)!
    acceptedBreaks.set(listOf( // (10)!
        "com.example.wire.Payment PROPERTY_REMOVED BACKWARD",
    ))
}
```

1. Root types to walk. Nested types and sealed subtypes reachable from these are
   included automatically — you don't list every type in the graph.
2. Points at a `Json { ... }` instance in your codebase so the classifier judges
   changes against your *actual* wire config (`ignoreUnknownKeys`,
   `encodeDefaults`, `explicitNulls`, etc.), not kotlinx-serialization's defaults.
   Leave empty only if you truly serialize with a bare `Json { }`.
3. The git ref extracted as the "old" schema to diff against. Any ref `git`
   resolves — a branch, tag, or commit SHA. **Optional:** leave it unset and
   serialkompat auto-detects your default branch (`origin/HEAD`, falling back to
   `origin/main`/`origin/master`, then a local `main`/`master`), so a `master`-default
   repo works without configuration. Set it explicitly to pin a specific ref.
   Overridable per-invocation with `-Pserialkompat.ref=<ref>` on the
   `serialkompatCheckAgainst` task without touching this file.
4. See [Choosing a direction](#choosing-a-direction) below.
5. When `false`, `BREAK` findings are reported but don't fail the build — useful
   for a soft-launch/audit period, not recommended long-term.
6. Guards against a silent no-op: if the baseline extraction comes back empty
   (wrong ref, types not yet on that ref, etc.), that's almost always a
   misconfiguration, not "everything's compatible." Set `false` only while
   adopting serialkompat on a repo where the baseline ref genuinely predates
   these types.
7. Restricts the check to serial names under this prefix. Default `[""]` (empty
   string) matches everything.
8. Prefixes to drop even if they matched `include` — for types that are
   intentionally unstable (internal-only, no cross-version contract).
9. Declares that `LegacyOrder`'s serial name became `OrderEvent`. Without this,
   the differ sees a type removed and a type added — two `BREAK` findings — where
   only one intentional rename occurred.
10. Format is `"<serialName> <RULE> [DIRECTION]"`. `DIRECTION` is optional — omit
    it to accept the break in every direction being checked; include it
    (`BACKWARD`/`FORWARD`) to accept it in only one. Each entry silences one
    specific finding; unrelated findings on the same type still fail normally.

## Choosing a direction

`direction` tells the classifier which reader/writer pairing has to survive the
change. Pick based on how the schema is actually used, not by default:

| Direction | Guarantees | Use when |
|---|---|---|
| `BACKWARD` | New code can read data written by old code | Rolling deploys — a newer service version must decode messages/events produced by instances still running the old version |
| `FORWARD` | Old code can read data written by new code | Persisted data with slow migrations, or mixed-version consumers — an older reader (a replica, a cached job, a client that hasn't upgraded yet) must decode records a newer writer just produced |
| `FULL` | Both | Public APIs, shared wire formats, or persisted data with no controlled rollout order — the safest default when you don't control both ends |

`FULL` is the default and the right choice unless you specifically know only one
direction matters. A queue where producers and consumers deploy independently, or
long-lived persisted rows read by code from any past version, need `FULL`. A
same-service rolling deploy where old instances are drained within minutes only
needs `BACKWARD` for that window — but relaxing to `BACKWARD` or `FORWARD` narrows
the guarantee, so only do it deliberately, not as a way to silence findings.
